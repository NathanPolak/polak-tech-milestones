     <h2 id="Theme">The First Computer Device</h2>
     <p id="Theme">The first deivce that has been created and is recognized as a computer is the abacus. It was first created roughly around 2500 BCE in Mesopotamia. It is basically a calculator that helps add and subtract numbers. It also has the ability to keep recent imputs and outputs on it until it is reset manually.</p>

         <h3 id="Theme">The First Idea of the Word Computer</h3>
         <p id="Theme">The very first time in documented history, the word computer was used as a job title rather than a device. This is seen in a book writen in 1613 by Richard Braithwait. During this time, computers were people who did calulations with occasional help from machines.</p>

         <h4 id="Theme">What Changed the Idea of a Computer?</h4>
         <p id="Theme">In the 1800s, more advanced computing devices came about that changed the idea of what a computer is. A device that is recognized for helping this change of thought was the Step Reckoner. Is was invented by Gottfried Leibniz in 1694. The device works a lot like an odometer in a car. This device was capable of multiplying and dividing and worked like an automated abacus.   </p>

         <h5 id="Theme">The Anaylitcal Engine</h5>
         <p id="Theme">The Analyitcal Engine was imagined by Charles Babbage while he was working on the Difference Engine. He never finished either project, but the Difference Engine was created using his notes later on. The Anaylitcal Engine would have been used for computations in general. A computer that could accomplish computations on it's own. Ada Lovelace develpoed programs and ideas for the Analyitcal Engine and is looked at as the world's first programmer. Charles Babbage is looked at as the father of programming for the idea of the Analyitcal Engine. </p>
